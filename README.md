# Advent Of Code 2024

My personal solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles.

## Usage

To run the solution for a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
binary <day> <part>
```
`<day>` and `<part>` can both be set to 0, which will run all days and both parts.
If no day is specified, the latest day will be run.
If no part is specified, both parts will be run.

I personally have two run tasks setup in intellij:
- Latest Day, Both Parts: runs main normally
- All Days: runs main with arguments 0 0
